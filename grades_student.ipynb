    "This program takes input from, presumably, an instructor, that includes each student's name and grades (4 test scores)\n",
    "That information gets slurped into a dictionary where each element is transformed into a list. Next, we explore taking the average for each student (all 4 test scores), class average (based on each student's average) and then cumulative averages for each test; i.e. average for test1, test2, etc. This information is plotted via plotly to see the variance relative to the mean. In the end, a dataframe is created that pulls in the aforementioned information, as well as creating new columns based on an applied curve and adding the letter grade based off the final adjusted grade."
