       " 'Everything about this resort was perfect from the room to the ocean/pool view and private balcony to the bed and fluffy pillows .  The workers were accommodating and very polite and friendly! I gave 4 stars only because I was promised a free upgrade from the site I booked from but Royal Sonesta said they didn’t see that on their end and I wasn’t able to find email at time !  I was there to celebrate my daughter’s Sweet 16 bday so time didn’t allow till last day and by then it didn’t matter !  I can’t see how they could possibly upgrade what was already perfect and  pure paradise already but still ! I paid a fortune expecting that extra but it’s not in them but the booking site !  They did however surprise her with a complimentary beautiful piece of chocolate cake with strawberries and blueberries and also delicious chocolate chip cookies in lieu of the upgrade so that was something and for that I’m grateful !  So for any future travelers all I can say is look no further than this resort because it is all that and more ! We absolutely Loved it here !  We are definitely coming back! ❤️ …',\n",

They were professional, polite, respectful and offered help advice or recommendations for touring,  dining. Our room was very very clean.  The King size bed, and sofa bed was very comfortable.  The Cabana #5 was our favorite.  We liked Ocean Breeze and Karaya restaurants on the property.  Everything taste delicious.  I was partial to the salmon, green plantains, yucca fries with parmesan/truffles, salad, chocolate cake to die for.  They had so much more, I don't eat meat.  I was so satisfied.    I want to give a SO to some people that took great care of us.  Diego, Benjamin, Josue,  William,  Efrain, Janista, Jose, Anais, Hilton.   You guys made our stay so great.

This was the third resort we stayed at during our vacation (different brand), this was by far the best service we received. Highly recommend.',\n",

The place was  very clean and the staff very friendly.  Beautiful pool and pool area.  Bottom line, I was bowled over by this reasonably priced gem of a hotel.  It is updated, pretty lobby area. Great outdoor spaces.  It's not nearly as fancy and opulent as the next door Fairmont, but we were looking for value for a fun couples weekend (and the Fairmont doesn't have the beachfront restaurant and bar!). We will return!\"]"

My only complaint was the woman at the front desk who refused to give us late checkout even though the hotel was empty. She was extremely rude but all the other staff members were completely amazing',\n",
       " 'Arrived early and was advised it would cost $120 for early check-in. Opted to wait by the pool for 3hrs which was fine.  The pool has lots of chairs, towels and umbrellas. The rooms were spacious, mini bar and frig.  Would leave the room in the morning for breakfast and arrive back after 3pm and the room was still not made.  For three days we just asked for fresh towels. A bit disappointed with the service.  The blow dryer needs to be updated to a better model. It took an hour to get my hair dry! The restaurant and gym were located near the beach, so if it was raining there is no way back without getting soaked.  The grounds are very pretty and staff was friendly. Overall it was an okay hotel, very quiet. No entertainment or casino.  We walked to the hotel next door each night. ',\n",

The staff is very caring and very accommodating. We want to thank our housekeeper Nilda and her helper from Cupey, Alexis at the Karaya lobby bar, Ida at the Aleli Restaurant, Diego at the Ocean Breeze, Don Efrain which greeted us during our stay in the pool gardens, and the the reception desk staff.

The food at the hotel restaurant and the pool/beach restaurant was good. In room coffee/tea maker wasn’t great. We found it fresh and flavorful, if overpriced. We tried for room service on our first morning since we had gotten in from the airport quite late the night before, but the number rang and rang and rang with no answer or message indicating that it was unavailable.

Walk out to the beach and one of the beach attendants will put up an umbrella over your lounger for no charge. The rooms are beautifully done, modern and sophisticated with large artwork.

He always had the biggest smile on his face and was a great person to see first thing in the morning. The pool area is very nice, we especially liked the white pool chairs for the shallow parts. There is a swim up bar, or you can walk to the bar and order, no one comes to you which is just different than other places in San Juan we’ve stayed. We do wish the music by the pool would’ve been louder, you can only hear it in one spot. The resort is right on the beach you just can’t always see the beach from the pool as the view is…',\n",
       " \"Excellent facility. Limited scope for breakfasts and dinner but good quality. Great attention to detail from concierge Antonio and food and beverages manager Jorge. It made my daughter's birthday memorable—wonderful cake from the cafe manager Jesus and his team. Great location. Great beach. Will go again\",\n",
       " 'Hotel is large with classic resort amenities and welcoming staff. Highly recommend a drink at the swim up bar from Pedro or chicken fingers from the beach restaurant. Complementary chairs and umbrellas right at the resort beach exit were a highlight as well. Hilton was the housekeeper for our floor and his service helped make our stay memorable. Hilton always wished us a good morning and asked if we needed anything. He brought a smile to our faces every time we left the room. With its easy access to a strip of hotel bars and casinos as well as the short car ride to Old San Juan, this resort was definitely one of the better on the island. ',\n",
       " 'The hotel was nice and in a good location..... What really made the difference for us was the people.... Special thanks to Manuel Rivera from the restaurant... He really went above and beyond to offer us good service and insights about places to see and things to do. Also our friendly Ariel from the towels, always happy to see us and also great recommendations. Overall a great experience in PR, the food, the music but above all the people. ',\n",
       " 'Very nice facility, clean, great pool, nice beach, good restaurants and staff is very friendly, helpful and considerate. Genuinely.   Our room cleaner, Hilton, was really friendly and made a different animal out of the towels each day… coming home to the room was always an exciting surprise.   We would definitely come back. ',\n",

The drinks were all Juice - ZERO ALCOHOL, and there were pigeons literally relieving themselves underneath the food stations.  When returning onto the Royal Sonesta property from the beach ( which is free, and Royal Sonesta\\'s \"Beach access\", isn\\'t actually an amenity) this lady pulled out her phone and began recording my girlfriend and I while saying \"Where is security, they\\'re letting these people on to the property\".   I thought nothing of it and got ready to leave.   I again noticed her staring HARD!! along with a colleague, and waved.  At this point, this lady followed us from the beach restaurant…',\n",

It was super clean and the staff (especially William!) was super friendly, helpful, professional and just all around terrific. (I have to mention my gratitude to the two women at the front desk who helped resolve a non-urgent medical issue, as well as our appreciation for the man and woman at the towel service. We had such a great conversation with them and felt like we made new friends.) Salvador was also awesome! Our room overlooking the ocean was gorgeous, there was very little noise at night, the pool is INCREDIBLE, and the hotel is super close to so many convenient things like CVS, Starbucks, and its 5 mins from the airport. We can’t wait to go back! Thanks again to William.…',\n",

Pedro and Jaders treated us like family at the pool, not only making great drinks but making the entire day a fun and personal experience (get an SJU tea, or 10). Josue and Diego at Ocean Breeze greeted us with smiles the minute we arrived at the resort and were quick to make us feel at home like they were our close friends.

Front desk staff and doormen were very pleasant and instantly accommodating. Our room was clean, there was an empty clean mini fridge that met our needs.

I never went to the desk because I didn't want to stress myself with little things but I have never been to a hotel that doesn't wait till the end to settle my charges.

Our first day we ate at the continental breakfast which we didn’t think was worth the price. Definitely recommend exploring the area around the hotel and getting some of the food in the area. We loved the food nearby! Most of the restaurants were a bit of a walk or a short Uber drive away. The Uber’s were normally like 4-7 dollars. Actually the convenience store across the street had really good breakfast burritos and an iced latte. I wish we would have tried it sooner. Pedro and Moises at the pool bar were the best! Pedro took such great care of us and got us to try new drinks instead of the same things we always get.  We always made to stop by for some drinks and conversation…',\n",

We arrived at 10:30pm and asked the hotel for a small discount on the resort fee which was $89! They refused and was very dismissive with our request. I also work in the industry and I know this is not an uncommon or unreasonable request  -lots of kids in the pool area, so can be loud. Also a lot of events in the hotel.  - overall, for the price I wish I stayed at another hotel, I’ve stayed in PR many times, there are better hotels.',\n",

Upon entering our assigned room we smell a lot of humidity, very strong odor, when we asked housekeeping if there was an issue with our room they responded that all rooms have the same problem. We assumed that the problem was temporary, but after a couple of days I got sick and could not breath easily, I guess it was the mold on the room. I complained to the front desk and they said that a manager would contact me and get me a refund. Two months later, still waiting for the call and a refund. Very bad management. ',\n",

We planning on getting one drink at the bar, but ended up staying for 3 hours talking and dancing and having the best time.

Grocery store and CVS nearby to stock up on snacks and beverages to keep costs down. Would stay here again.',\n",

The breakfast buffet was excellent. Rooms were very musty but that seems to be a common thing in the Caribbean from my experience going to different islands. There were personal items left behind in the drawers so it’s my assumption the maids aren’t checking and cleaning those. Staff was very friendly. Overall, a good experience.',\n",

The  restaurant option in side hotel, in the property and round the hotel are good. Good variety restaurants and cafes.   The distance from the airport was perfect, just 10 mins.   The only problem was the tracing to old town, if afternoon or non traffic hrs it’s fine. But if it’s a peak traffic time then coming back from old town took 45 mins.

The Ocean Breeze restaurant/bar was more our vibe -- lobster rolls and frozen drinks -- and the service there was perfect. The beach is full service and is also very low key.

Everyone was very friendly, especially Nestor, who was so kind and helped us with our excursions and dining reservations.  We had a minor billing issue that was quickly resolved.  Many of the beach areas in Puerto Rico have strong rip currents and are unsafe to swim, but the Royal Sonesta, located in Isla Verde, had calm, safe waters.

Dinners at the outside bar were wonderful as well. Koraya Bar if I remember correctly.

We had no toilet tissue, which is bizarre since the bathroom was cleaned. The trash was not removed, and when we placed food trash in a bag outside the door, we found it there the next day.

They failed to change them for the remainder of the stay…. Never experienced this.   Also, minor, but room phone did not work. They worked on it for 3 days, couldn’t fix it.   Try to avoid.

Isaac stayed in communication leading up to our event, even staying on top of the weather minute to minute and putting a back up plan in place in case of rain.

Nothing fresh, frozen or canned food, what a disappointment when you pay such a high price and you're sitting that close to the Atlantic ocean.

He made the cutest towel animals each day. I got a butterfly, an elephant, and this beautiful (and quite elaborate) heart and swan sculpture on my birthday— all made from towels! Plus there was a sweet birthday card!!!  It’s the small touches like that that make a place me t level. Also HUGE rainforest shower was a plus plus plus.  Will be back for sure!',\n",

Pool is fantastic.  After years of problems at staying at the El San Juan was a nice change to have a seamless trip. I would absolutely return. Kid loved it.  Beachside restaurant is fantastic. Beautiful views of both pool & amazing beach. Only a Ruth Chris or bar for dinner. $60 steak not ideal for most families.  Emily at front desk, William bell desk & Antonio at concierge all especially nice to my kid. Really make us feel special. People you want as staff on a vacation.

The rooms were spacious, mini bar and frig.  Would leave the room in the morning for breakfast and arrive back after 3pm and the room was still not made.  For three days we just asked for fresh towels. A bit disappointed with the service.  The blow dryer needs to be updated to a better model. It took an hour to get my hair dry! The restaurant and gym were located near the beach, so if it was raining there is no way back without getting soaked.  The grounds are very pretty and staff was friendly. Overall it was an okay hotel, very quiet. No entertainment or casino.  We walked to the hotel next door each night. ',\n",

We want to thank our housekeeper Nilda and her helper from Cupey, Alexis at the Karaya lobby bar, Ida at the Aleli Restaurant, Diego at the Ocean Breeze, Don Efrain which greeted us during our stay in the pool gardens, and the the reception desk staff.

The food at the hotel restaurant and the pool/beach restaurant was good. In room coffee/tea maker wasn’t great. We found it fresh and flavorful, if overpriced. We tried for room service on our first morning since we had gotten in from the airport quite late the night before, but the number rang and rang and rang with no answer or message indicating that it was unavailable.

We arrived at 10:30pm and asked the hotel for a small discount on the resort fee which was $89! They refused and was very dismissive with our request. I also work in the industry and I know this is not an uncommon or unreasonable request  -lots of kids in the pool area, so can be loud. Also a lot of events in the hotel.  - overall, for the price I wish I stayed at another hotel, I’ve stayed in PR many times, there are better hotels.',\n",

Upon entering our assigned room we smell a lot of humidity, very strong odor, when we asked housekeeping if there was an issue with our room they responded that all rooms have the same problem. We assumed that the problem was temporary, but after a couple of days I got sick and could not breath easily, I guess it was the mold on the room. I complained to the front desk and they said that a manager would contact me and get me a refund. Two months later, still waiting for the call and a refund. Very bad management. ',\n",

The  restaurant option in side hotel, in the property and round the hotel are good. Good variety restaurants and cafes.   The distance from the airport was perfect, just 10 mins.   The only problem was the tracing to old town, if afternoon or non traffic hrs it’s fine. But if it’s a peak traffic time then coming back from old town took 45 mins.

The Ocean Breeze restaurant/bar was more our vibe -- lobster rolls and frozen drinks -- and the service there was perfect. The beach is full service and is also very low key.

How did they get in to the grounds. We did not feel  safe after that.  The staff at the property  in different areas kept asking is  for our room number and last name.

Additionally, the resort fee (separate from the room charge and paid on arrival) is almost $70/day on top of very high taxes and fees. You can’t get a drink or food order taken from the pool or beach; they even told a guy at a paid cabana on Saturday that he’d need to come pick up his food at the bar.

Everyone was very friendly, especially Nestor, who was so kind and helped us with our excursions and dining reservations.  We had a minor billing issue that was quickly resolved.  Many of the beach areas in Puerto Rico have strong rip currents and are unsafe to swim, but the Royal Sonesta, located in Isla Verde, had calm, safe waters.

Our server Silvia was helpful and deliver our champagne. The bar manager wearing an orange shirt made things better, he was  checking on us throughout the day.

There are basic things that a hotel should provide and should not even be part of a review, but you guys have to do better. ',\n",
       " 'I typically do not write reviews, but this was an absolutely horrible stay. The worst Royal Sonesta among all hotels in the chain. Management is terrible, does not care. Housekeeping does a terrible job. Asked for sheets to be changed. They ignored the request. Talked to the manager about it. The manager tried to make me feel as if it was my fault! They failed to change them for the remainder of the stay…. Never experienced this.   Also, minor, but room phone did not work. They worked on it for 3 days, couldn’t fix it.   Try to avoid. Plenty of other properties is the area that care about customers more. ',\n",
       " 'We had a lovely almost week’s long vacation at the Sonesta, with most of our time spent poolside, and enjoying food and drink at the Ocean Breeze restaurant. Our trip kicked off with 25 person welcome dinner (this was a group of colleagues traveling together) organized by the Ocean Breeze’s Manager Isaac Varon and his team. Isaac stayed in communication leading up to our event, even staying on top of the weather minute to minute and putting a back up plan in place in case of rain. The evening was a success and Isaac and his team continued to deliver great service throughout the following days of our trip. Can’t wait to come back!',\n",

The hotel is near many excellent restaurants.',\n",

I loved the Juliet balconies and the showers in the hotel room, the hot tub was a popular spot, the poolside bar and Ocean Breeze restaurant had the most engaging and friendly staff, and the front desk and lobby bar staff were also very attentive. BUT, my man, Chef Luis in the La Bodeguita, the little café off to the side past the front desk, was the sweetest and greatest guy for when my friends and I would come back inside hungry and craving some good eats. He made the BEST sushi for us and you can tell he really cared about the work he was doing and the guests he was serving. This one is for you Chef, you are amazing!',\n",

He gave us many suggestions about the different places to visit/eat.  Nester, the hotel concierge, was such a pleasure to meet and he was incredibly kind and accommodating.  He was super helpful when it came to booking the hotel as well as making our stay comfortable and enjoyable.

The pool area is lovely and large enough to be able to spend the day and you can also go to the beach. I prefer the beach however be forewarned - on Friday, Saturday and  Sunday, the NOISE from the hotel Fairmont next door is obnoxious.

It made us laugh every time we went back to our room at the end of the day. Thank you Hilton! Excellent staff and resort!

We ended up using the cocktail voucher to have dinner twice since a lot of food was included as an \"appetizer\" (i.e. burger for my son, chicken fingers for my daughter).

I didn't get that though. While staff is mostly warm, service is not up to par. At the breakfast, we had to restate our order 3 times to get it right, food was ok but not great and the buffet underwhelming. Worst point was the food by the pool. Nothing fresh, frozen or canned food, what a disappointment when you pay such a high price and you're sitting that close to the Atlantic ocean.  Pool equipment is also dated, rusty sun shades and when we asked if we could get an extra one to put shade on our baby, it was such a problem. Not the type of experience you expect for a 700usd nightly rate and an expensive menu.…\",\n",

One of the staff members Hilton has been doing a great job keeping our room tidy each day. He has made towel animals for us to come back to which we have loved! Thank you Hilton',\n",
       " 'Perfect spot, great hotel, pool is lively and kid friendly but also fun for adults. Beach is awesome and near to jet skis and parasailing offerings. Great service by all, especially the breakfast buffet folks. Easy location to get around. We walked to CVS, souvenir shops, and restaurants. Quick rides to El Yunque and Old San Juan too. We stayed in the club suite, which was perfect for our family of 4 with convenient access to the pool and beach. Another plus to the club room is the balcony to sit on, versus the tower rooms that are standing-only balconies. Club area has a coffee machine but we otherwise received vouchers for breakfast and dinner appetizers and drinks.',\n",
       " 'Hotel is very nice and in a great location. 7 to 10 mins from SJU airport. I did not experience any rudeness from the staff as it says in a few other reviews here. The front desk staff were very friendly. We did however have issues with cleaning service during our stay. They did not come regularly to clean the rooms and refresh the towels. We had to ask several times for fresh towels. It was 4 of us in the room, so maybe they did come by but saw the train wreck we had and were like, nope, well wait for them to leave. We stayed four nights. My other family member was just one person in the room and they cleaned her room everyday, sooo... the property itself is awesome. The pool is great and the beach is magnificent. They have chairs and umbrellas and little tables to put your…',\n",
       " 'In Royal Sonesta,San Juan ,Puerto Rico,nice hotel to spend time with family and friends.Food delicious and Manuel Rivera in the restaurant Alelic has the  best service ever ,Highly recommended,thank you Manuel for everything ,see you next time !!!!',\n",
       " 'Our room.attendant Hilton was exceptionally friendly and detail...leaving us animal towel decorations. The doormen were so courteous and went the extra mile. Rey one of the valet guys was gracious enough to walk me over the next door hotel as i was not sure exactly what entrance to use to visit their casino and night club.',\n",
       " 'Chef Luis A is an amazing cook. Very humble and kind. I definitely recommend his delicious meals😋!! My kids are very picky eaters but instead they loved his food and wanted seconds!! Go check him out!',\n",
       " 'Really nice resort. All the staff are very nice and the services provided are great. The pool and beach area are beautiful and enjoyable. The gym is full of plenty of gear to stay in shape and the rooms are very comfy. The surrounding area has great eats and views being so close to old sam Juan. If you are looking for a relaxing and enjoyable family trip, this is a great place to go.',\n",
       " 'Spent my husbands 50th birthday here with our 2 older teenage boys.  Hotel and grounds are beautiful and spotless. Every staff member we encountered was extremely friendly and helpful and very accommodating! Late checkout was no problem. If you sign up for sonesta rewards you get a later checkout.  Fee to stay later than 12 I think and they had no issue holding our luggage after we checked out since we had a later flight.  Refrigerator in room was out of order when we arrived.  Called front desk and a new one was brought up within 15 min! Only complaint was the price of food and drinks. Would definitely stay here again to visit this beautiful island.',\n",
       " 'My Lord! I have never been in a hotel where they treat you like family!!!  From the time we arrived to the hotel and was greeted by valet to the check in and the time at the pool I was treated like a queen! Well not just myself but 4 of my girls friends as well! I am allergic to onions and I have been craving an o tipis salad. No where in the island I have been able to enjoy an octopus salad but Chef Luis Almodovar at the Ocean Breeze fix a plate for me that I I can’t even explain how delicious it was. Out of this world I was not even expecting him to serve me such delish!!  Our server Michael Figueroa gave us the best service ever! Checked on us, chat with us kept our table free of clutter and was very attentive and making sure that no onions where around me!!  Issac the…',\n",
       " 'Amazing hospitality and great food and service at the ocean breeze Royal Sonesta PR. Come down and see Michael F. as your server! Isaac the manager greeted us and made sure we had a great food experience. Big shout out to chef Luis Almodovar He went above and beyond to make sure those in our guest party who had food allergies would have a great food experience and made it fresh and appetizing! Thank you for your amazing service!']"
